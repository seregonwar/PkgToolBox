## Description
PS4 PKG Tool is a tool for manipulating PS4 PKG files. It allows you to extract, inject, modify, and obtain information about PKG files.

## Contributions
- **[Sinajet](https://github.com/sinajet/)**: Creator of **[PS5-Game-Info](https://github.com/sinajet/PS5-Game-Info)**, used in the program to read `eboot.bin` packages from `.pkg` files and recognize whether they are fpkg or not.
- **[HoppersPS4](https://github.com/HoppersPS4)**: Creator of c++ version [Waste_Ur_Time](https://github.com/HoppersPS4/Waste_Ur_Time) rewritten and implemented in PS4_Passcode_Bruteforcer.py module.

If I forgot to add anyone below, please let me know on [X](https://x.com/SeregonWar)!
## Features
- **Extraction**: Extract specific files from a PKG.
- **Injection**: Inject new data into an existing PKG file.
- **Modification**: Modify the header of a PKG file.
- **Information**: Obtain detailed information about a PKG file.
- **File Explorer**: Navigate and manage files within the PKG using an integrated file explorer.
- **Hex Reader**: View and edit files in hexadecimal format.
- **Text Reader**: View and edit text files.
- **Delete**: Delete files from the PKG.
- **Trophy Management**: Load, unpack, read, and manage trophy files.
- **Trophy Creator**: Create new trophy files for games, customizing icons, descriptions, and achievements based on specific game requirements or user preferences.
